#   GITHUB USERA FINDER APP
This is an app that allows users to search for other github users to see their repos and latest actions.

## PROCEDURE
An index.html is first of all created to comprise all the necessary divs such as the search-container with its input field for typing usernames and a search button. Other divs comprise of user details such as their ratings, most recent github repositories and other befitting icons to show for.

Next is a detailed style.css file which contains all the interactive and intuitive stylings common to github and its repositories with a hidden class that disables the visibility of the repositories until a username has been inputted and searched.

Then comes the javascript file which is also for interactivess as well as accurate functionality of the application. The search button is brought to live upon a click to search for any specific user; a showError function is provided to warn a user via an "alert", against clicking to search without providing a username; and lastly displayUserData and formatDate functionality to specify how much details one can view upon clicking the search button and also to update the date.


## CONCLUSIVELY
The application is adaptable to various devices as low as below 600px display/frame width.
